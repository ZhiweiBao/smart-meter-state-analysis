# Visualization for Smart Meter Assembly Line - State Analysis

## Basic information

- Date: Apr. 2018 - Dec. 2018
- Description: The software is mainly used to monitor the status of many verification devices (20 pieces) in the assembly line of smart meters. By monitoring the data uploaded to the database of verification devices, the algorithm is used to get the detection results, and the detection results are visually displayed in the UI.

## Requirements

- OS: Windows 7, 8 and 10
- MATLAB Runtime R2018a(9.4). Url: https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html 
- Database: Oracle
